This workshop is taught using the following components, which you will install and configure in the sections that follow. 

*(Note: Due to the nature of working with large-scale systems, it may not be possible for you to set up everything you need to perform each lab exercise.  Participation in each Activity is optional - we will be working through the exercises together, but if you cannot install any software or don't have an Azure account, the instructor will work through each exercise in the workshop. You will also have full access to these materials so that you can work through them later when you have more time and resources.)*

For this workshop, you will use Microsoft Windows as the base workstation, although Apple and Linux operating systems can be used in production. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise" target="_blank">download a Windows 10 Workstation `.ISO` to create a Virtual Machine on the Hypervisor of your choice for free here</a>. 

The other requirements are:

- **Microsoft Azure**: This workshop uses the Microsoft Azure platform to host the Kubernetes cluster (using the Azure Kubernetes Service), and optionally you can deploy a system there to act as a workstation. You can use an MSDN Account, your own account, or potentially one provided for you, as long as you can create about $100.00 (U.S.) worth of assets.
- **Azure Command Line Interface**: The Azure CLI allows you to work from the command line on multiple platforms to interact with your Azure subscription, and also has control statements for AKS.
- **Python (3)**: Python version 3.5 (and higher) is used by the SQL Server programs to deploy and manage a Big Data Cluster for SQL Server (BDC).
- **The pip3 Package**: The Python package manager *pip3* is used to install various BDC deployment and configuration tools. 
- **The kubectl program**: The *kubectl* program is the command-line control feature for Kubernetes.
- **The azdata utility**: The *azdata* program is the deployment and configuration tool for BDC.
- **Azure Data Studio**: The *Azure Data Studio* IDE, along with various Extensions, is used for deploying the system, and querying and management of the BDC. In addition, you will use this tool to participate in the workshop. Note: You can connect to a SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster using any SQL Server connection tool or application, such as SQL Server Management Studio, but this course will use Microsoft Azure Data Studio for cluster management, Jupyter Notebooks and other capabilities. 

*Note that all following activities must be completed prior to class - there will not be time to perform these operations during the workshop.*

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity 1: Set up a Microsoft Azure Account</b></p>

You have multiple options for setting up Microsoft Azure account to complete this workshop. You can use a Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) account, a personal or corporate account, or in some cases a pass may be provided by the instructor. (Note: for most classes, the MSDN account is best)

**If you are attending this course in-person:**
Unless you are explicitly told you will be provided an account by the instructor in the invitation to this workshop, you must have your Microsoft Azure account and Data Science Virtual Machine set up before you arrive at class. There will NOT be time to configure these resources during the course.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png"><b>Option 1 - Microsoft Developer Network Account (MSDN) Account</b></p>

The best way to take this workshop is to use your [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) benefits if you have a subscription](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).

- [Open this resource and click the "Activate your monthly Azure credit" button](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/)

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png"><b>Option 2 - Use Your Own Account</b></p>

You can also use your own account or one provided to you by your organization, but you must be able to create a resource group and create, start, and manage a Virtual Machine and an Azure AKS cluster. 

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png"><b>Option 3 - Use an account provided by your instructor</b></p>

Your workshop invitation may have instructed you that they will provide a Microsoft Azure account for you to use. If so, you will receive instructions that it will be provided.

**Unless you received explicit instructions in your workshop invitations, you much create either an MSDN or Personal account. You must have an account prior to the workshop.**

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity 2: Prepare Your Workstation</b></p>
<br>
The instructions that follow are the same for either a "base metal" workstation or laptop, or a Virtual Machine. It's best to have at least 4MB of RAM on the management system, and these instructions assume that you are not planning to run the database server or any Containers on the workstation. It's also assumed that you are using a current version of Windows, either desktop or server.
<br>

*(You can copy and paste all of the commands that follow in a PowerShell window that you run as the system Administrator)*

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">Updates<p>

First, ensure all of your updates are current. You can use the following commands to do that in an Administrator-level PowerShell session:

<pre>
write-host "Standard Install for Windows. Classroom or test system only - use at your own risk!"
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

write-host "Update Windows"
Install-Module PSWindowsUpdate
Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate
Get-WindowsUpdate
Install-WindowsUpdate
</pre>

*Note: If you get an error during this update process, evaluate it to see if it is fatal. You may receive certain driver errors if you are using a Virtual Machine, this can be safely ignored.*

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">Install Big Data Cluster Tools</p>

Next, install the tools to work with Big Data Clusters:


<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity 3: Install BDC Tools</b></p>

Open this resource, and follow all instructions for the Microsoft Windows operating system


 **NOTE:** For the `azdata` utility step below, [use this MSI package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/deploy-install-azdata-installer?view=sql-server-ver15) rather than the `pip` installer.

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/deploy-big-data-tools?view=sql-server-ver15](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/deploy-big-data-tools?view=sql-server-ver15)

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity 4: Re-Update Your Workstation</b></p>

Once again, download the MSI and run it from there. It's always a good idea after this many installations to run Windows Update again:

<pre>
write-host "Re-Update Windows"
Get-WindowsUpdate
Install-WindowsUpdate
</pre>

*Note 1: If you get an error during this update process, evaluate it to see if it is fatal. You may recieve certain driver errors if you are using a Virtual Machine, this can be safely ignored.*

**Note 2: If you are using a Virtual Machine in Azure, power off the Virtual Machine using the Azure Portal every time you are done with it. Turning off the VM using just the Windows power off in the VM only stops it running, but you are still charged for the VM if you do not stop it from the Portal. Stop the VM from the Portal unless you are actively using it.**
